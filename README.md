> Welcome to the official Faithful Dungeons repository!

- All recently made textures will be uploaded here. 
- If you find any Issues, please report them [here](https://github.com/Faithful-Dungeons/Resource-Pack/issues). 
- All textures are made from this [.zip](http://www.mediafire.com/file/c9p05bw59rdunw4/Dungeons_textures.zip/file) file made by @Pomik108.
- This GitHub is structured in the same way as the .zip provides.
